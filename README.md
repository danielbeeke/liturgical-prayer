# Liturgical prayer app

With this app you can have liturgical prayers.
It uses a google spreadsheet as its database source.
The app does not have a backend for user data this is stored locally instead.

The main architecture is LighterHTML and Redux. All other things are custom code.
There is a router that is also stored in Redux so time traveling for debugging is possible
